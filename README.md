# Overview

This is a simple mobile app version of the Simon Says memory game. Once the user presses start, the buttons on the screen will flash one at a time in a random order, and the user must repeat the sequence of buttons in order to progress to the next level. Game continues until user makes a mistake or exits.

I made this app to explore the process of mobile app creation. I was able to learn how to use Android Studio and the Kotlin language.
